# FloppyBird
FlöppyBird is yet another open-source Flappy Bird clone (please don't sue me) written in Lua, using the Löve2d Game Engine.



## Changelog:
*wow so empty*



## Roadmap:
(✅ added features, 🔜 planned features, ❓ unsure)

* 🔜 Unlockable Skins for your bird
* 🔜 Background and Foreground objects (clouds, grass, small rocks, etc.)
* ❓ Special Abilities



## Building from source:
Building from source is easy! Execute the following command:

`./build.sh BUILD_NAME` 

The final build will be located in `/.build/builds/`. The build script builds a native Windows Executable and a .love file, which can be run with the Löve2d Game Engine.



### Installing Löve2d Game Engine:
Love2d comes with Lua built into it, you dont have to download Lua 5.4 seperatly.

* Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S love`
* Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo snap install love`
* Windows and other systems: [Love2d Download](https://love2d.org)
